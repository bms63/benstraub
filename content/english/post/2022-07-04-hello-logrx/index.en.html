<p>Hi all!
Great news! We have logrx up on CRAN. The goal of logrx is to facilitate logging in a clinical environment with the goal of making code easily traceable and reproducible. This forms one part of a burgeoning end to end pipeline for doing Clinical Reporting with R.</p>
<p>Please check out the pharmaverse if you are interested in seeing packages for creating ADaM datasets, TLFs or using metadata to drive your analysis or helping to prepare your R work for submission to a regulatory agency.</p>
<p>If you want to get started with logrx check out our website at A Logging Utility Focus on Clinical Trial Programming Workflows â€¢ logrx (atorus-research.github.io) and if you spot a pesky bug or have an idea for an enhancement, then please log an issue on our GitHub Repo: <a href="https://atorus-research.github.io/logrx/" class="uri">https://atorus-research.github.io/logrx/</a>.</p>
<p>logrx was formally known as timber, but we had to change it as CRAN already had a package called timber!</p>
