Hi all!
Great news! We have logrx up on CRAN. The goal of logrx is to facilitate logging in a clinical environment with the goal of making code easily traceable and reproducible. This forms one part of a burgeoning end to end pipeline for doing Clinical Reporting with R. 

Please check out the pharmaverse if you are interested in seeing packages for creating ADaM datasets, TLFs or using metadata to drive your analysis or helping to prepare your R work for submission to a regulatory agency.

If you want to get started with logrx check out our website at A Logging Utility Focus on Clinical Trial Programming Workflows â€¢ logrx (atorus-research.github.io) and if you spot a pesky bug or have an idea for an enhancement, then please log an issue on our GitHub Repo: https://atorus-research.github.io/logrx/. 

logrx was formally known as timber, but we had to change it as CRAN already had a package called timber!
