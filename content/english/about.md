A simple presence on the internet was helped by Hugo and the R package blogdown.  My aim is to show a curated selection of tne open source projects that I work on to help with the burgeoning effort to use R for Clinical Reporting.  

This site will also showcase different clinical reporting efforts that I have lead or assisted while at GSK.
